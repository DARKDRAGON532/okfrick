- has one memory pointer
- has less than 5 characters hopefully
- works well
- is turing complete (possibly)

```markdown
+ - increase memeory pointer value
( - start loop (only if the pointer is not 0)
) - end loop (only if the pointer is 0)
! - send output
? - receive input
```

i promise this is not brainf without the 30k memory cells and `-` thing

when the memory reaches 255 (u8) and you add to it it becomes 0 
goodluck make cool things and if u do tell me what u made thanks
